          |We measure the gains from phasing out coal as the average social
          |cost of carbon times the quantity of avoided emissions. By comparing
          |the present value of benefits from avoided emissions against the
          |present value of costs of ending coal and replacing it with renewables,
          |our conservative baseline estimate is that the world can realize a net
          |gain of $85 trillion. This global net social benefit can be attained
          |through an international agreement to phase out coal. We also explore
          |how this net benefit is distributed across countries and find that most
          |countries would benefit from a global coal phase-out even without any
          |compensatory cross-country transfers. Finally, we estimate the size of
          |public funds that must be committed under a blended finance arrangement
          |to finance the cost of replacing coal with renewables.
