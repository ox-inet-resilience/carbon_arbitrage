          |We measure gains from phasing out coal as the social cost of carbon
          |times the quantity of avoided emissions. By comparing the present
          |value of benefits from avoided emissions against the present value of
          |costs of ending coal and replacing it with renewables, our baseline
          |estimate is that the world can realize a net gain of $78 trillion. A
          |way to reap this huge gain is to strike a Coasian bargain – as a
          |complement to incomplete carbon pricing – to provide blended
          |financing to replace coal with renewables. We quantify requisite
          |climate financing for supplanting coal with renewables across the
          |world.
